### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an engineer with interest in applied ML and software development.

ðŸ”­ I'm a core maintainer and ML engineer of [Yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and co creator of [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
   
   On the side, Iâ€™m currently working on deploying deep learning models on edge devices. I'm working on android/IOS/Web development using React.

âš¡  Some of my other notable open source contributions:

* [Yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) - Most commits  after the creator. Built Segmentation support and MLOps features that allow users to make their pipelines device independent, enable better tracing and utilize spot instances.

* [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) - Added support for W&B backend for hyperparameter tuning for transformer models.

* [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) - Worked with FAIR to build W&B integration to manage experiment tracking and model evaluation.

* [SpaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) - Built experiment and dataset management integration with W&B.

* [PyCaret](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret) - Redesigned entire dashboard logging API from scratch to support all types of experiment types in AutoML. ([PR](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/pull/2231))

* [Coqui-TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) - Built experiment management API and added support for W&B. 

* [CycleGan-and-Pix2Pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) - Added support for training and inference tracking. 

* [Wandb](https://github.com/wandb/client) - Built a console login timeout feature which supports teletype consoles for all platforms( Linux, Unix, and Windows).
