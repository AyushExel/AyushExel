## About me:
- I wanted to do independent ML research while I was in undergrad but thought of giving industry a try.
- So then I worked at Weights & Biases for around 2.5 years and led OSS channel for the ML team back in 2020. Things became a bit boring after it became the market leader and I thought I missed doing hardcore ML research. 
- So I worked with Ultralytics to co-author Ultralyitics/yolov8 framework & yolo5-seg with laughing-q, the fist and only real time instance segmentation model (which a lot of frameworks simply copied without understanding why it worked so well). Both those tools are used by millions of users, power 1000s of OSS projects and get downloaded over a 100K times everyday.
- I'm currently working on LanceDB - the best vectorDB on planet powered by the best OSS storage layer for multi-modal AI, lance.
