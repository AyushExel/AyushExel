## About me:
- I wanted to do independent ML research while I was in undergrad but thought of giving industry a try.
- So then I worked at Weights & Biases for around 2.5 years and led OSS channel for the ML team back in 2020. Things became a bit boring after it became the market leader and I thought I missed doing hardcore ML research. 
- So I worked with Ultralytics to co-author Ultralyitics/yolov8 framework & yolo5-seg with laughing-q, the fist and only real time instance segmentation model (which a lot of frameworks simply copied without understanding why it worked so well). Both those tools are used by millions of users, power 1000s of OSS projects and get downloaded over a 100K times everyday.
- I'm currently working on LanceDB - the best vectorDB on planet powered by the best OSS storage layer for multi-modal AI, lance.

### Where to find my content:
- I don't like going to talks and I'm too lazy to write blog posts but sometimes I do post videos on my youtube channel. I think I've done a good job to keep it technical till now, but I don't intend to be genre specific.
- However, there are some important learnings that I've had over the years building dev tools, and getting them accepted by millions of users across industries. Here's some things that are written in plain english, that I believe will help any engineer, or product manager or anyone else who wants to build or is building a devtool.

### Things I learned building devtools
- [WIP] **The psychology of devs (1): How to go about making tools & features loved by devs** - This introduces a repeatable, scientific way of going about making successful dev tools & features on purpose and not by accident.
- [WIP] **Getting your tool adopted: done with the MVP? Time to iterate** - How to know when to put yourself in users' shoes and when to go out looking for feedback. And oh, remember getting users is hard, and getting good and actionable user feedback is harder. And knowing the difference between the 2 is hardest.
